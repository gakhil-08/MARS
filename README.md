# 🏥 Patient-Centric Clinical Workflow & Coordination System

## 📌 Problem Statement

Hospitals involve multiple departments such as doctors, nurses, pharmacies, and diagnostic units. 
Clinical requests are often handled manually, updates are delayed, and patient data is scattered across systems.

This project builds a patient-centric workflow system where all clinical actions are organized 
around a single patient record with real-time updates.
