Project Title

Patient-Centric Clinical Workflow & Real-Time Hospital Coordination System

Description

Hospitals involve multiple departments such as doctors, nurses, pharmacies, and diagnostic units. These departments often work in fragmented systems, leading to delayed updates, miscommunication, and lack of visibility into patient status.

This project provides a patient-centric workflow system where all clinical actions are organized around a single unified patient record.

The system allows:

-Doctors to create prescriptions, diagnostic requests, and care instructions

-Departments to receive and update requests

-Real-time status tracking

-A shared patient timeline visible to all stakeholders

The focus is on:

-Structured clinical workflows

-Real-time coordination

-Transparent action tracking
